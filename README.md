# Phylogenetics
Automating the Phylogenetic Tree Formation Process
#This will be my attempt at automating some processes associated with phylogenetic tree formation
#Overview of Process
#Step 1: Access literature with ascension data, access data via GenBank
#Step 2: Copy and Paste sequence data into a new file
#Step 3: Edit sequence data to remove unnecessary titular characters
#Step 4: Add self-generated sequence data and edit
#Step 5: Import .txt file to MAFFT online for alignment, SAVE AS .nxs
#Step 6: Import .nxs file to SEAVIEW, SAVE AS .fst
#Step 7: Import .fst file to raxmlGUI
#Step 8: Run Model Test on .fst file
#Step 9: Run test
#Step 10: Open .support.tre file in FigTree
#Step 11: Print .support.tre file
